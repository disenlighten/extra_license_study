** Intro
I'm taking my first steps to formalize study materils for the Extra Class license! I have a number of study materials, but so far my efforts have been all over the place and not focused.
*** Gordon West's Extra Class Book
*** Extra Exam Prep iPhone App
*** ARRL Extra License Manual

My plan is to go in depth in this document into topics that I'm struggling with and questions that I got wrong in practice tests. 

Talking to Scott yesterday, he was telling me that his method was 15 minutes in the morning, 15 minutes at night of studying.
